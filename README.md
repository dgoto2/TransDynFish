### TransDynFish
This repository contains the data and code used in "[Transient demographic dynamics of recovering fish populations shaped by past climate variability, harvest, and management (Goto, 2023)](https://bit.ly/46wjUZE)". The analysis was performed to explore how time-varying local and regional climate conditions contribute to the transient dynamics of recovering fish populations exposed to variable fishing pressures by applying a multilevel (hierarchical) modeling approach to demographic metrics of 38 stocks comprising 11 species across seven northeast Atlantic ecoregions.

##### Time series of the transient population growth rates of 36 northeast Atlantic fish stocks during 1946â€“2016. Red lines indicate transient growths computed from age-specific abundance and demographic rate estimates taken from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) 2017 stock assessment reports. Blue lines indicate transient growth rates computed from 1000 simulated datasets with Gaussian noise added to recruit numbers and fishing mortality rates, which is based on stock- and year-specific standard deviation.
